            <p>
              Driver's ed will be the biggest time commitment when getting your
              permit. All online courses will cost money, although if your
              school offers driver's ed you can take that class (although it'll
              take more time). I recommend using Aceable Driving, and you can
              buy their California Driver's ed course{" "}

            <h3>Driver's ed info</h3>
            <p>
              Driver's ed is going to be long and boring. It's projected to take
              about 30 hours, but if you read quickly you can get through it in
              less time. It took me about 4 months to complete because I'm very
              lazy, but I know people who have done it in 2-7 days. <br />
              <br />
              The point is, make sure to pay attention during the course, but
              not all the information is ultra important. Don't skim, but you
              also don't need to read it like a textbook. Most decisions on the
              road are split second, and it is much more practical to use logic,
              common sense, and basic road knowledge than it is to spend
              valuable time trying to remember exactly what complex law driver's
              ed told you to do. Just don't make stupid decisions that break
              laws, and you'll probably be fine.
