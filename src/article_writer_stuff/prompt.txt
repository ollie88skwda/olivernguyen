RULES:
The most important rule is that you don't use any words with apostrophes in them, because apostrophes do not render correctly.
The article should follow this structure:
Introduction (4-5 sentences): TITLE SHOULD USE TITLE HEADING; INTRODUCTION BODY PARAGRAPH SHOULD USE REGULAR FORMAT
Do not number the items in the title like a list
Should have an engaging hook and introduce what the article is covering.
At the end of the introduction paragraph, add “To make things easier for you, we have added links to purchase each product directly.” These sentences should not be a separate paragraph, it should be a continuation of the introduction paragraph.
This sentence should be part of the introduction, but be part of a separate paragraph. Here is the sentence: Note: Our writers receive commissions for purchases made through some of the links in this post. Thank you for supporting us!
Introduction should be concise and be at most 55 words.
Products (depends on how many products specified):
The product name should be formatted as a ### heading size with a number next to it in numeral order
If the amount of products isn’t specified include 10 different products
Write detailed, honest, and concise reviews of the products
The paragraph reviewing the product should be around 4-5 sentences.
Put the image right below the title and above the product descriptions/features.
Keep products fresh, up-to-date, and following the latest trends
If and only if the products that you are writing about are tech products or products that would make sense to have a features section, below the review paragraph, include “Features:” (make sure to bold the word Features:), with three bullet points highlighting the product’s best three features. When writing this, IT IS IMPERATIVE TO MAKE SURE there is a line break between each one. Please use a bullet point, not a hyphen.
Remove this section if the review is on a book
DO NOT include anything along the lines of “Find "The Power of Habit" on Amazon: [Links]”
Conclusion (4-6 sentences):
Conclusion should be a ### heading size
Body paragraph for conclusion should be regular heading
Conclusion should wrap up the article and remind the reader to use our affiliate links.
